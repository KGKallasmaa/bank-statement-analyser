Your task is to extract all transactions from the provided bank statement page.

For each transaction, extract:
1. Date - in YYYY-MM-DD format
2. ID - the transaction ID (if available)
3. Description - the transaction description or payee
4. Amount - the transaction amount as a decimal number
5. Currency - the currency code (USD, EUR, etc.)
6. Type - whether this is a "debit" (money leaving the account) or "credit" (money entering the account)

IMPORTANT RULES FOR AMOUNT:
- For debits (money leaving the account), use NEGATIVE numbers (e.g., -100.00)
- For credits (money entering the account), use POSITIVE numbers (e.g., 100.00)
- Do not include currency symbols in the amount field

If the statement uses terms like:
- "Withdrawal", "Payment", "Debit", "Charge" → These are debits (negative amounts)
- "Deposit", "Credit", "Refund", "Interest" → These are credits (positive amounts)

Return the transactions as a list of Transaction objects.
